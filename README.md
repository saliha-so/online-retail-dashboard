- Detect high-value customers based on their total spending.
- Analyze monthly sales trends and observe behavioral shifts over time.
- Track new customer acquisition patterns and explore retention challenges.

- **Tableau** â€“ Data visualization and dashboard creation.

## Key Insights

### Sales Distribution by Country
- **Australia** had the highest total spend by far, indicating a strong market or possibly a data anomaly.
- European countries such as the UK, Netherlands, and Germany followed.
- Due to data irregularities, some customers appeared to be linked with multiple countries.

### Top 10 High-Spending Customers
- The highest-spending customer had a significantly higher total spend than the others.
- The top customer segments can be valuable targets for loyalty or upselling strategies.

### Monthly Sales Trend
- A sales spike occurred in **November 2009**, followed by a sharp drop and long-term plateau.
- This pattern may suggest a one-time promotional event, launch period, or seasonality.

### New Customer Acquisition
- A parallel drop in new customers after November 2009 mirrors the sales trend.
- The company may have struggled with customer retention or continuous acquisition strategies.

## Business Recommendations

- **Focus on top-performing regions** like Australia and the UK to optimize marketing and logistics.
- Implement **customer retention programs** to address declining engagement.
- Consider segmenting and targeting high-spending customers for premium offers.
- Investigate the cause of the November 2009 spike to replicate or better manage future campaigns.
